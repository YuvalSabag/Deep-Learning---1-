## Deep Neural Network

This project explores the construction, training, and evaluation of a simple neural network implemented from scratch using PyTorch. The focus is on understanding and implementing the **forward and backward propagation processes** and experimenting with advanced techniques. The neural network is applied to the MNIST dataset for classification tasks.
