## Deep Neural Network

This project explores the construction, training, and evaluation of a simple neural network built "from scratch" using **PyTorch** to classify images from the **MNIST dataset**.  
It combines practical implementation with conceptual exploration, emphasizing a thorough understanding of neural network training.

### **Key Objectives**
- Implement all components of the **forward and backward propagation** processes.
- Train the network using **vectorized operations** for enhanced computational efficiency.
- Explore the use of **batch normalization** to improve training stability and convergence.
- Apply **L2 regularization** to enhance generalization and prevent overfitting.
- Compare different network configurations to understand their impact on performance and efficiency.
- Evaluate the network's ability to learn from and classify data accurately while generating detailed analytical reports.

This project provides hands-on experience in designing and optimizing deep learning models.  
It also highlights the significance of advanced techniques like batch normalization and regularization in enhancing training outcomes.
