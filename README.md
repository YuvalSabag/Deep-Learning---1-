## Deep Neural Network

This project explores the fundamentals of deep learning by implementing a simple neural network **from scratch** using PyTorch. The assignment aims to provide a hands-on understanding of the **forward and backward propagation processes** and covers the entire pipeline of building, training, and evaluating a neural network on the MNIST dataset.
